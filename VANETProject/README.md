SUMO version 0.19 Required

This project references inetmanet-2.0 forked from aarizaq/inetmanet-2.0

inetmanet-2.0 inetmanet-2.2 branch from git pulled 5/30/2015

You will need to have my version of inetmanet-2.0 as there are some small changes in order to get this project to build.

VEINS (3.0) included in src in VANETSim, no reference needed (currently excluded from build)

Be sure to edit your path for all launchd.xml in VANETSim/simulations/_maps/[simulationtype]
